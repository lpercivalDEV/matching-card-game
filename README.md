# Matching Card Game - Proof of Concept
This simple application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to play a matching card game.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a simple app where a user can click on a set of different cards to play a simple matching game.

As a user clicks on a card, the word on the "other side" of the card is revealed and remains visible until the user clicks on a second card. If the cards are a match, they both turn green and then disappear. If the cards are not a match, they flip back over so that the user can make another attempt.

Once a user matches all the cards, they will see a message stating that they won the game.

## Optimizations
As it is right now, my app is more like a proof of concept. It works, but it's not the slickest looking application.

If I had more time to work on this project, I would mainly want to improve the CSS to make the app look more appealing. I would want to add photos of the actual animals instead of just the words by themselves. I would also like to add a bit more animation and make the cards span out into their grid locations on game restart like a real deck of cards.


## Lessons Learned:

This project taught me about how to transfer all of the JavaScript skills I learned and combine them with the HTML and CSS I have under my belt. Using JavaScript to dictate the behavior of the cards as well as to populate the DOM when a user wins the game is a game changer for me. I feel like I now have much more freedom to create cool new projects and games like this one.
